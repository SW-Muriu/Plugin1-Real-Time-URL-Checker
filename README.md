Plugin to Extract Real-Time URLs and Separate Query Parameters

This plugin aims to accomplish the following:

1. Extract real-time URLs from a website.
2. Separate the query parameters from the URLs.


The key features of this plugin include:

1. Real-time URL extraction: The plugin should be able to dynamically fetch and extract URLs as they appear on the website.
2. Query parameter separation: The plugin should be able to isolate the query parameters from the main URL structure.
3. Robust handling: The plugin should be able to handle a variety of URL structures and query parameter formats.
4. Customizable settings: Users should be able to configure the plugin to suit their specific needs, such as the URL patterns to extract or the way the query parameters are presented.

By providing these capabilities, the plugin can be a valuable tool for web developers, data analysts, and anyone who needs to work with dynamic URL data from a website.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
